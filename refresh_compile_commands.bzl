""" refresh_compile_commands rule

When `bazel run`, these rules refresh the compile_commands.json in the root of your Bazel workspace
    [creating compile_commands.json if it doesn't already exist.]

Best explained by concrete example--copy the following and follow the comments:
```Starlark
load("@hedron_compile_commands//:refresh_compile_commands.bzl", "refresh_compile_commands")

refresh_compile_commands(
    name = "refresh_compile_commands",

    # Specify the targets of interest.
        # This will create compile commands entries for all the code compiled by those targets, including transitive dependencies.
        # It's optional, but if you're reading this, you probably want to. 
    # If you're doing this manually, you usually want to just specify the top-level output targets you care about.
        # This avoids issues where some targets can't be built on their own; they need configuration by a parent rule. android_binaries using transitions to configure android_libraries are an example.
    # The targets parameter is forgiving in its inputs.
        # You can specify just one target:
            # targets = "//:my_output_binary_target",
        # Or a list of targets:
            # targets = ["//:my_output_1", "//:my_output_2"],
        # Or a dict of targets and any flags required to build:
            # (No need to add flags already in .bazelrc. They're automatically picked up.)
            # targets = {
            #   "//:my_output_1": "--important_flag1 --important_flag2=true", 
            #   "//:my_output_2": "",
            # },
        # If you don't specify a target, that's fine (if it works for you); compile_commands.json will default to containing commands used in building all possible targets. But in that case, just bazel run @hedron_compile_commands//:refresh_all
        # Wildcard target patterns (..., *, :all) patterns *are* allowed, like in bazel build
            # For more, see https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/guide.html#specifying-targets-to-build
```
